In this little project, I used what I have learned about building a PostgreSQL database to create a Celestial Bodies Database. 

| Files | Description  |
| --- | --- |
| **`universe.sql`** | A dump of the database I created. Due to my lack of interest in outer space, the database contains a mix of real, untraditional and fictional celestial bodies. |
| **`universe_erd.jpg`** | An entity relationship diagram showing the tables in the universe database, and relationships between the tables. Created with [draw.io](draw.io).|
